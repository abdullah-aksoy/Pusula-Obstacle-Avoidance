# üöó Obstacle Avoidance Using LIDAR (A2M12)

This project demonstrates an autonomous obstacle avoidance system using the **RPLIDAR A2M12** sensor. Our mobile robot continuously scans its environment up to a range of **12 meters**, detecting obstacles in real-time with high accuracy. Using this data, the robot navigates autonomously by following predefined waypoints (waypoint navigation) while dynamically avoiding obstacles detected on its path.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Obstacle Avoidance in Action

Watch our robot operating in **guided mode**, where it follows predefined waypoints (WPs) while continuously scanning for obstacles. Upon detecting an obstacle within its path, the robot dynamically recalculates its trajectory to avoid collisions, demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance using the LIDAR sensor's data.
